Hello, I'm Raymond!! I'm going to work on translating the MIDI files into understandable text with the notes + the number of ticks corresponding to the time each note is played. I will also work on doing this process backward (translate the output of the algorithm again into a MIDI file)!

For translating MIDI files into lists of notes, you can use the following

We can also use the midifile library on c++ which is made for this purpose ( You can find a lot of information and tutorials about that on github!

Hi I'm Kayo and I'm going to work on the neural network :)
